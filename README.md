## Task monster rpg

Concept:

1. Each user have an avatar
2. The user sets a goal - to learn a new language, complete a project, etc.
3. Goal was autofilled with chatGPT and similar content
4. The more user achieve in that goal - the more he is stronger against some monsters
5. Monster fights with users and each other in real time
6. Each victory - unique info/links/quests for user's goal

#### TODO:
- Add chatgpt client
- Mechanism for fill users goals after they completed task
- Storage for users and their tasks
